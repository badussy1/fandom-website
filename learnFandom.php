        <h5 class="title">About TWICE</h5>
<p id="info">TWICE is a 9-member girl group which debuted under JYP Entertainment on October 20th, 2015. They debuted with the song, "Like Ooh-Ahh". The group consists of the following: Nayeon, Jeongyeon, Momo, Sana, Jihyo, Mina, Dahyun, Chaeyoung, and Tzuyu. Some of their hits include "Cheer Up", "What is Love", "The Feels", "Scientist", and "I Can't Stop Me". The girls are often remembered for their outstanding and powerful vocals, sticky raps and fun choreographies. Every girl has her unique talent!
  All the girls started on a survival show by the name of SIXTEEN, where they were competing to be in one of the top entertainment agency's newest girl group. Competition included Jeon Somi (soloist) and Chaeryeong (ITZY). 7 out of the 9 current TWICE members made it to the top 7. Although 2 of them (Momo and Tzuyu) did not make it to the top 10, it was found that they just had something that added to TWICE in specific. Therefore, they were added, and shortly after that, they debuted.
  The reason why they are called TWICE is because they capture listeners' attention not once, but twice! Once with the eyes, and once with the ears. Therefore, their fans are called ONCE because "even if you only love [them] once, [they] will repay you with twice of [their] love".</p>
