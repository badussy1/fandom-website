  <h5>Welcome to the rules page.</h5>
      <h6>In order for the site to operate properly, it's important that we keep a small set of rules to keep the environment positive and neutral. So, here's our list that needs to be abided by in order to use the site. If the moderation team finds that there is a violation of any of these rules, then there will have a three-strike rule, until the user is banned. Thank you for your understanding.</h6>
      <ol>
<li>Make sure that you are respectful and kind to all users on the platform. Transphobia, homophobia, racism, or any other kind of bigotry will not be tolerated by the moderation team. Leave that to Twitter ;)</li>
<li>We, as the unofficial fanclub, want to keep this a positive environment where people can escape from the trenches of every day life. Any dissension, political topics, religion and such which has nothing to do with discussion of the original content will be taken down immediately.</li>
<li>You should be at least fourteen years of age to be on this website, however the moderation team has no control of this rule at this time. Therefore, if you see something that is not innapropriate, but mature, that is not the fault of the original user or the website/moderation team. Please take into consideration that sometimes there are difficult topics discussed on this website.</li>
<li>Please use trigger warnings for common phobias/triggers (e.g. vomit, blood, flashing lights, murder, abuse, mention of children in mature conversation, etc). We want this to be a place where mature topics can be discussed in a civilized and kind manner, and we do not want to hurt or upset anyone. <strong>If a trigger warning is not placed on a possibly triggering topic, the moderation team will add one to the post, and a profile strike will be issued to the original post creator.</strong></li>
<li>And of course, please limit talk not associated with the original material. This is a fandom website, after all. Don't worry! We're working on something to separate these topics.</li>  
      </ol>
    <h6>Thank you for abiding by these rules! They are subject to change, and if/when they do, you will be the first to know.</h6>
